This release introduces a more advanced LSB (Least Significant Bit) method
based on integers sets. The sets generated with Python generators
(Sieve of Eratosthenes, Fermat, Carmichael numbers, etc.) are used to select
the pixels used to hide the information. You can use these new methods in your
Python codes as a Python module or as a program in your scripts.


### 0.3 (2011-04-15)

- you can now use Stéganô as a library in your Python program;
  (python setup.py install) or as a 'program' thanks to the scripts provided

  *reveal* function for the LSB method. Moreover it is now possible to hide a
  binary file (ogg, executable, etc.);
- a new technique for hiding/revealing a message in a JPEG picture by using the
  description field of the image is provided.
